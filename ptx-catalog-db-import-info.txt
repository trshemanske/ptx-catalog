'A textbook for an introductory linear algebra course with an
algebraic approach that serves as a transition course for math majors,
emphasizing definitions, theorems, and proofs.',

it all, now converted to PreTeXt (its third source format).</p>
		  
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">

This book is aimed at mathematics majors, seeing their first course
after calculus that stresses theorems and their proofs.  It contains a
very thorough introduction to the use of the open source system,

<a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a>, for linear algebra.  Besides
an extensive collection of traditional exercises, there are also reading
questions for each of the thirty-seven (daily) sections.</p>',
