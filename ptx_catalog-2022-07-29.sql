We have put an emphasis on\n          understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way. Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum,\n          most of the questions here are at a higher level. Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by\n          our questions have applications to secondary mathematics. This emphasis is quite different than other mid level\n          discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research\n          mathematics.\n        </p><p>\n          While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice. As you\n          will see, almost all of the textbook consists of <em>Activities</em> and <em>Exercises</em> that guide students to\n          discover mathematics for themselves. This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but\n          we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics.

As you\'ll soon discover (if you have not discovered already), academic writing is a practice with its own conventions and expectations. Academic inquiry is about using the best possible evidence to grapple with contested issues. Academic writing places special emphasis on rigorous use of evidence to substantiate claims, on clear and specific theses, and on the framing of arguments within scholarly contexts. These traits distinguish academic writing from most popular writing (the type of writing that one finds on blogs, in newspapers and magazines, and on Facebook). Though it is possible to discuss <q>academic writing</q> as a coherent entity, academic writing is also diverse and reflects writers\' own personal, disciplinary, and sub-disciplinary biases. (Take a look at the example student essays included in the Resources section of this book.) In Sound Writing, we hope to provide you with the essentials of university writing so that you can write with as little stress and as much success as possible. Inside this book, you\'ll find a breakdown of research, composition, and revision processes; strategies for overcoming common writing challenges; advice from faculty members; a guide to APA-, Chicago-, and MLA-style citations; and much more.</p>','0000000000000',NULL,NULL),('rocca-CTHI','Cryptology Through History and Inquiry',NULL,'GFDL',NULL,NULL,2017,NULL,NULL,1,3,1,'https://sites.wcsu.edu/roccac/cryptology-through-history-inquiry/','https://github.com/cfroccajr/Inquiry-Into-Cryptology','https://sites.wcsu.edu/mbxml/html/Intro_Crypto_Main.html',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'A hands-on, original source, look at the evolution of cryptology.','','1111000000000',NULL,NULL),('rodman-IBLA','An Inquiry Based Introduction to Linear Algebra',NULL,'CC','SA','4.0',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,4,3,'https://lovelace.augustana.edu/rodman/html/','','https://lovelace.augustana.edu/rodman/html/','','',NULL,NULL,'These notes provide a carefully scaffolded sequence of definitions, problems and theorems that guide the student to discover the basics of Linear Algebra while developing their proof writing ability.','<p>I am currently working to replace the problems that support each proof with interactive WeBWorK problems.

We have also provided a set of more challenging Projects at the end of each chapter.</p><p>Function notation is introduced in Chapter 1 and is used consistently in subsequent chapters treating the various families of functions.  We study functions using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods, and work to establish the connections between these approaches. We want students to learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a table of data, and extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.  Many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. By taking advantage of graphing utilities, we can examine a large number of examples and study them in detail, and we can consider more realistic models.</p><p>An in-text Exercise or <q>Checkpoint,</q> with answers, follows each Example, allowing students to try out new concepts and skills as they are presented.

Students preparing for technical courses may not need much of the material after Chapter 6 or 7.  Chapters 9 and 10 cover vectors and polar coordinates, optional topics that occur in some trigonometry courses but are often reserved for precalculus.</p><p>Chapter 1 reviews only the most basic facts about triangles and circles that students will need to begin their study of trigonometry, and may be omitted or assigned as homework.  Other facts about functions and angles are introduced when they are needed.</p><p>Chapter 2 introduces the three (not six) basic trig ratios, and considers angles in the first quadrant only.  This initial simplicity allows students to focus on the fundamental concepts without simultaneously trying to master a welter of peripheral detail.</p><p>Chapter 3 introduces reference angles for the second quadrant in order to study obtuse triangles and the Laws of Sines and Cosines.  Reference angles are covered again in more generality in Chapter 4.</p><p>Chapter 4 considers angles as rotations in preparation for the graphs of sine and cosine.  Applications of periodic functions in this chapter are functions of degrees only.  Radians come later, after students have some experience with sinusoidal graphs.</p><p>Chapter 5 begins with a section on algebraic manipulations with trig ratios, a skill that is often neglected but can engender endless confusion for students.   We solve equations both graphically and analytically, and we use graphs as well as algebra to verify trigonometric identities.</p><p>Chapter 6 introduces radians and the circular functions of real numbers.  Most of this chapter and Chapter 7 revisit basic skills such as analyzing graphs and solving equations, but working now in radians rather than degrees.</p><p>Chapter 8 studies identities and their use in more detail, including the sum and difference formulas and the double angle identities.  Inverse trig functions are included here, and the three reciprocal trig functions.</p><p>Chapters 9 and 10 cover ancillary topics; typical trigonometry courses may include one or more of these topics:  vectors, polar coordinates, and complex numbers.</p><p>Each Example in the book is followed by a similar Exercise for students to test their understanding.  Each Section concludes with a Summary, a set of Study Questions, and a list of Skills to be addressed in the Homework.  A Summary and a set of Review Problems follows each chapter.  Chapters 1 through 8 include Activities for students to work through some of the main ideas.  We have described the use of a graphing calculator, but other graphing utilities can easily be substituted.</p>','1101000100000','AIM',NULL);
