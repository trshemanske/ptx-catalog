There are three programs that intertwine:

The start page is ptx-catalog-identify.php.   It's job is to decide if you are updating an existing
project or entering a new one.  It will search for xml_id's given a valid substring, so if you search for beezer,
all of beezer's known xml_id's will be displayed.

Enter an existing one to update, or a new one to create a new project.  New project creation asks for the number of coauthors.

The update program, queries the database and populates the form with the existing data which you are free to edit and submit.

The insert program starts with a blank slate.

If something gets messed up, you really have to go back to the identify page since that page propagates the xml_id to the others.

Successful submission of an insert of update simply says data has been submitted for processing, which means it has written a
sql file for import following the instructions below.



Advance prep for using the insert/update scripts for the ptx_catalog database.
This assumes you have php installed on your webserver.  If you also install phpmyadmin, my guess is most
of the dependencies relating php and apache will be loaded.



cd to the directory containing the identify, insert and update scripts

Make a directory titled ptx_catalog_updates which will receive the sql insert and update
statements made by the scripts.  The webserver needs write permissions to that directory.

So on a debian/ubuntu linux system with apache as the webserver we have:

sudo mkdir ptx_catalog_updates
sudo chown directory-owner.www-data ptx_catalog_updates
sudo chmod 770 ptx_catalog_updates


Once  updates are received, they should be visually inspected before uploading to the Mysql/Maria database
to ensure nothing nefarious is being submitted. Backslashes are escaped in the fields:
title, subtitle, one-sentence and full descriptions, so Math should work,
e.g., \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0. \)

Then sudo to root

As root

mysql ptx_catalog < xml_id-datestamp.sql

or perhaps

mysql -u root -p ptx_catalog < xml_id-datestamp.sql

if you have not set up a
.my.cnf file in root's home directory in the format:

[client]
user=root
password=root password for mysql access


If there are errors at the stage of inserting the mysql statements, you can just manually edit the sql files and retry.

Note that the scripts upload changes first to projects and then to coauthors.
If the error occurs within the projects part, just fix the file and retry.
If the update to projects succeeds, and fails in coauthors, you can either delete the projects entry (phpmyadmin or command line mysql),
fix the file and try again, or remove the updates to projects and fix the coauthor's entry.
